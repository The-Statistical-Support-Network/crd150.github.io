## **Course Objectives**

In this course, students will gain

* A foundation in critical thinking and reasoning skills based on data
* Skills in acquiring data from a wide range of reliable public and private sources 
* An understanding of the differences between spatial and nonspatial data
* Skills in data cleaning and management 
* An understanding of how to appropriately present nonspatial data in tables and graphs and spatial data in maps
* Skills in descriptive analysis of nonspatial and spatial data
* Proficiency in data analytic tools, specifically R
* An understanding of how these methods are employed in community research

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Course Format**

The course is organized into two phases. 

* Part 1: Analyzing communities using nonspatial data.  Topics include descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis, data presentation, and visualization.  As the major source of national community-level data in the United States, the U.S. Census will be extensively covered.    

* Part 2: Analyzing communities using spatial data. Topics include exploratory spatial data analysis, U.S. Census geography, mapping, big data, government open data, participatory mapping, geodemographic modelling, spatial clustering, and site suitability analysis.

</div>
### **Lecture**

The Tuesday/Thursday classes will be a combination of lecture, in-class exercises and examples covering the week’s substantive topics.  For some lectures, I will ask you to bring your laptops to go through some data acquisition examples and software program exercises. 

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
### **Lab**

The Friday lab will provide hands on practice using real data.  Each lab will provide guides that will be released on the lab website at the beginning of lab.  The guides will provide step-by-step instructions on executing specific tasks using a software program.  Lab guides may go over the 1-hour lab time; you will then need to complete the guide on your own time.  


<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Required Readings**

Required reading material is composed of a combination of the following 

1. (OSU) O’Sullivan, David & David Unwin (2010). Geographic Information Analysis. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley & Sons 

This is the only required textbook for the class. Luckily, the textbook is free and can be found [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470549094). I will also provide the assigned chapters as pdfs on Canvas.  A hard copy of the book can be purchased through the campus bookstore or your favorite online book vendor.

2. Journal articles, research reports, and book chapters.

These are available on Canvas.

3. My handouts

For some topics, in lieu of an article or book chapter, I will provide lecture notes on Canvas in advance of the assigned class.  

## **Additional Readings**

The other major course material are lab guides, which will be released at the beginning of each lab on the lab website.  Many of the R lab guides will closely follow two textbooks.  These textbooks are not required, but are great resources. 

The first textbook covers the first part of the course (nonspatial data)

* (RDS) Wickham, Hadley & Garret Grolemund. (2017). R for Data Science. Sebastopol, CA: O’Reilly Media.

The textbook is free online at: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html  

The second textbook covers the second part of the course (spatial data)

* (GWR) Lovelace, Robin, Jakub Nowosad & Jannes Muenchow. (Forthcoming) Geocomputation with R. CRC Press.

The textbook is free online at: https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>
## **Course Software**

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is the only statistical language used in this course, as it has become an increasingly popular program for data analysis in the social sciences.  R is freeware and you can download it on your personal laptop and desktop computers.  We will use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as a user friendly interface for R.  Lab computers will also have R and RStudio.  

We will also introduce the mapping programs [StoryMapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/), and [Carto](https://carto.com/).

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

## **Course Requirements** 

1. Assignments (35%)

Assignments will be released on the lab website each week at the beginning of lab and will be due the following week on Canvas.  Assignment questions are located at the end of each lab guide. They will contain a combination of programming tasks and theoretical questions that you will need to answer on your own.  For each assignment, you will need to submit R Markdown Rmd and html files on Canvas. Assignment guidelines can be found [here](https://crd150.github.io/hw_guidelines.html).  If you get stuck you can seek help from the TA, who will be available in the scheduled lab sessions and during office hours.  We also encourage you to work with other students, **but you must submit your own assignment**.  

Late submissions will be deducted 10% per 24 hours until 72 hours after the submission due time.  After 72 hours your submission will not be graded.  No exception unless you provide documentation of your illness or bereavement before the due date.  If you cannot upload the assignment on Canvas due to technical issues, you must email it as an attachment to your assigned lab TA by the submission due time.

2. Midterm exam (25%)

There will be a comprehensive in-class midterm examination that will test conceptual material covered in lecture, readings and lab.  The exam will be written and will consist of multiple choice and short answer questions.  You will not be expected to write or interpret code. If you fail to show up for the exam, you will receive a grade of zero.  The only exception made is for a documented illness (yours) or bereavement (others) provided prior to the time of the examination.  

3. Final course paper (35%)

The purpose of the final course project is to provide students the opportunity to apply the concepts and methods learned in class on a real-world problem of their choice.  You can work alone or in a group of at most two people.  The project will be completed in phases, which are designed to ensure progress throughout the quarter.  The project will involve choosing a specific community (city, metro area, or county) and answering a question about that community.  The project will involve (i) identifying a community of interest (city, metropolitan area or county that has a population size greater than 250,000); (ii) identifying a question you want to answer for that community; (iii) finding some data that pertain to the community and topic of interest; (iv) organizing those data so that you can analyze them; (iv) performing some analysis on the data; and (v) presenting your results to the class (in a lightning talk) and (vi) in a short final term paper. More detailed information of project parameters are provided on Canvas in the document *final_project_description.pdf* in the Final Project folder.

4. Class participation/attendance (5%)

Attendance in all classes and labs are strongly encouraged. However, we will not take attendance.  If you miss a class it is your responsibility to get the lecture/lab notes from classmates. Note that I will be introducing material in lecture that extends material covered in the readings.  You will be responsible for understanding this extended material for assignments and the midterm. Also note that given the class size I will know each of your names.  This means don’t take the 5% class attendance/participation lightly as that can sway your grade one way or another.
